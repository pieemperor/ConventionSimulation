# ConventionSimulation
This was my fourth project in my Data Structures class. It gave me experience using Queues and a PriorityQueue.

This project was meant to simulate a large quantity of people registering at a convention center
on the day of an event. When the program launches, it displays a window asking for the settings for
the registration. It asks for the number of expected registrants, length of each registration, opening and closing 
times for the convention center, and a couple other options. Then, it takes those options and runs a simulation showing 
people entering and leaving the lines as time goes on. The simulation keeps track of what the longest line was throughout
the simulation. 

This project gave me experience working with random number generation based on different distributions. It also
gave me experience working with Queues and PriorityQueues. These were used to manage the enter and departure events 
that were happening as well as the registrants waiting in the registration lines. 

We were supposed to write a report that stated how many lines were required to keep the max line length at 5 people or less. 
I included that report in this repository.
